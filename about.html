        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>We are a trust worthy platform dedicated to helping Strathmore University students buy and sell items among themselves and other people.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to provide a convenient and secure platform for Strathmore students to sell their items to other students, reducing the hassle and cost of moving belongings at the end of the semester.</p>
        <h2>Challenges Faced by Strathmore Students</h2>
        <p>In Strathmore, numerous students from different countries find it challenging to relocate their luggage at the end of their studies, mostly due to the large volume they need to transport back home. The issue is concerned with the struggles that students face in transporting their possessions, such as suitcases, clothes, shoes, and even textbooks. The long distances between residences and educational institutions create high shipping costs and possible transit damage.</p>
        <p>The issue of relocating the possessions of the students in Strathmore arises from the substantial volume of belongings they accumulate during their studies, combined with the long distances between their homes and the school. This results in high shipping costs, possible transit damage, financial strain, and logistical challenges during the checkout process. Moreover, limited support systems and cost considerations exacerbate the problem, highlighting the need for a system that would allow Strathmore students to resell or auction off their belongings after the end of their studies.</p>
        <p>Students in Strathmore, especially international students and those from different regions in Kenya, are significantly affected by the challenge of high shipping costs incurred during the relocation of their possessions. The combination of substantial volumes of belongings and long distances from their homes causes financial strain on students, potentially limiting their ability to relocate their belongings. Without a solution to this issue, students will continue to face high shipping costs, leading to financial strain.</p>
        <h2>Existing Challenges with Current Solutions</h2>
        <p>Various businesses have tried to tackle the problems that these students face, but they still grapple with issues like user engagement, fraud, and inadequate product descriptions, which lead to reputational damage. The consequences of not solving this problem include financial strain on students, potential disputes between buyers and sellers, and a diminishing trust in online auction platforms. Existing solutions like international courier services and auctions such as FedEx, DHL, Nellion, and JIJI lack tailored support for students and are very expensive, making it hard for students to use them.</p>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>To address these challenges, we have developed a web-based resale and auctioning system designed specifically for Strathmore students. This system aims to reduce costs and facilitate the relocation of their belongings by providing them an effective resale and auctioning platform.</p>
